#Static Web

This was a little project that I made for quickly generating static websites and
pushing them to a webspace over ftp.

When I made this, I didn't know about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

# You need to install the Gems

Use :
	java -cp StaticWeb.1.0-SNAPSHOT-Combined.jar org.jruby.Main -S gem install -i gems compass
